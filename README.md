# AWS-Projects
This repository contains a collection of projects designed to demonstrate my skills in cloud architecture, infrastructure management, and application deployment using AWS. Each project explores various AWS services and solutions, including serverless architectures, CI/CD pipelines, real-time data processing, disaster recovery, and security best practices.
# Key Projects
Serverless Web Application: A photo-sharing app using AWS Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB, and S3, demonstrating a fully serverless architecture.

1. CI/CD Pipeline with CodePipeline: Automated deployment for a microservices application using AWS CodePipeline, CodeBuild, and CodeDeploy.

2. Real-Time Analytics Platform: A streaming data analytics platform using AWS Kinesis and Elasticsearch for processing and visualizing data in real-time.

3. Multi-Tier Web Application: A scalable, high-availability web application using EC2, RDS, and ELB, showcasing a traditional multi-tier architecture on AWS.

Each project includes detailed documentation, infrastructure diagrams, and setup instructions to guide you through the architecture and deployment process. This repository is a showcase of my practical experience with AWS, applying best practices to create secure, scalable, and efficient cloud solutions.
