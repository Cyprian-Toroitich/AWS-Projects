# Static Website Hosting on Amazon S3

This project demonstrates how to host a static website using Amazon S3 with additional features like versioning, lifecycle policies, and cross-Region replication to enhance availability, durability, and cost efficiency. The website serves as an online presence for a caf√©.

Summary
Overview
In this project, an S3 bucket is configured to host a static website, with public access enabled. Advanced features like versioning, lifecycle management, and cross-Region replication were also added to improve functionality and durability.

Technologies Used
Amazon S3: Primary service for file storage and static website hosting.
IAM (Identity and Access Management): Used for setting permissions for cross-Region replication.
Setup and Configuration
Task 1: Extracting Website Files
Objective: Prepare the HTML, CSS, and image files for the website.
Actions:
Downloaded the .zip file with the website assets.
Extracted the files to obtain the index.html file and folders for CSS and images.
Task 2: Creating an S3 Bucket for Hosting
Objective: Create an S3 bucket configured for static website hosting.
Actions:
Created an S3 bucket in N. Virginia (us-east-1) Region.
Disabled "Block all public access" to allow public access.
Enabled static website hosting, specifying index.html as the index document.
Task 3: Uploading Content to the S3 Bucket
Objective: Upload the website files to S3 for hosting.
Actions:
Uploaded index.html, CSS, and images to the bucket.
Verified the setup by accessing the website through the S3 endpoint.
Task 4: Configuring Bucket Policy for Public Access
Objective: Set up automatic public read access for all objects in the bucket.
Actions:
Configured a bucket policy to grant read-only permissions to public, anonymous users.
Verified that all uploaded objects are publicly accessible without additional configurations.
Task 5: Enabling Versioning
Objective: Enable versioning to keep track of changes.
Actions:
Enabled versioning on the S3 bucket.
Made changes to index.html (updated bgcolor attributes) and uploaded the modified file.
Verified that previous versions were retained and accessible in the S3 console.
Task 6: Setting Lifecycle Policies
Objective: Manage older versions to optimize storage costs.
Actions:
Configured two separate lifecycle rules:
Rule 1: Move older versions to S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (IA) after 30 days.
Rule 2: Delete older versions after 365 days.
These policies help control storage costs by automatically archiving and expiring outdated versions.
Task 7: Enabling Cross-Region Replication
Objective: Set up cross-Region replication for redundancy and disaster recovery.
Actions:
Created a second S3 bucket in another AWS Region and enabled versioning on it.
Enabled cross-Region replication on the source bucket with the CafeRole IAM role for required permissions.
Configured the replication rule to replicate all objects from the source to the destination bucket.
Summary
This project demonstrates how to host a static website on Amazon S3 with additional features:

Static Website Hosting: Configured the S3 bucket to serve as a public static website.
Automated Public Access: Applied a bucket policy for simplified, automated public access.
Version Control: Enabled versioning to manage and track changes over time.
Lifecycle Management: Set up lifecycle rules to archive and delete older content, optimizing storage costs.
Cross-Region Replication: Configured cross-Region replication for improved redundancy and disaster recovery.
By implementing these configurations, this project showcases a robust and scalable approach to static website hosting on AWS.
