# Project: Static Website Hosting on Amazon S3

This project demonstrates how to host a static website using Amazon S3 with additional features like versioning, lifecycle policies, and cross-Region replication to enhance availability, durability, and cost efficiency. The website serves as an online presence for a caf√©.

## Overview
In this project, an S3 bucket is configured to host a static website, with public access enabled. Advanced features like versioning, lifecycle management, and cross-Region replication were also added to improve functionality and durability.

## Technologies Used
- **Amazon S3**: Primary service for file storage and static website hosting.
- **IAM (Identity and Access Management)**: Used for setting permissions for cross-Region replication.

---

## Setup and Configuration

### Creating an S3 Bucket for Hosting
1. **Objective**: Create an S3 bucket configured for static website hosting.
2. **Actions**:
   - Created an S3 bucket in **N. Virginia (us-east-1)** Region.
   - Disabled "Block all public access" to allow public access.
   - Enabled static website hosting, specifying `index.html` as the index document.

---

### Uploading Content to the S3 Bucket
1. **Objective**: Upload the website files to S3 for hosting.
2. **Actions**:
   - Uploaded `index.html`, CSS, and images to the bucket.
   - Verified the setup by accessing the website through the S3 endpoint.

---

### Deploy using AWS Amplify
1. **Objective**: Set up automatic deployment using AWS Amplify.
2. **Actions**:
   - Autamitacally create an Amplify App that deploys the website for us.

---

### Enabling Versioning
1. **Objective**: Enable versioning to keep track of changes.
2. **Actions**:
   - Enabled versioning on the S3 bucket.
   - Made changes to `index.html` (updated bgcolor attributes) and uploaded the modified file.
   - Verified that previous versions were retained and accessible in the S3 console.

---

### Setting Lifecycle Policies
1. **Objective**: Manage older versions to optimize storage costs.
2. **Actions**:
   - Configured **two separate lifecycle rules**:
     - **Rule 1**: Move older versions to **S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (IA)** after 30 days.
     - **Rule 2**: Delete older versions after 365 days.
   - These policies help control storage costs by automatically archiving and expiring outdated versions.

---

### Enabling Cross-Region Replication
1. **Objective**: Set up cross-Region replication for redundancy and disaster recovery.
2. **Actions**:
   - Created a second S3 bucket in another AWS Region and enabled versioning on it.
   - Enabled cross-Region replication on the source bucket with the **CafeRole** IAM role for required permissions.
   - Configured the replication rule to replicate all objects from the source to the destination bucket.

---

## Summary
This project demonstrates how to host a static website on Amazon S3 with additional features:
- **Static Website Hosting**: Configured the S3 bucket to serve as a public static website.
- **Automated Public Access**: Applied a bucket policy for simplified, automated public access.
- **Version Control**: Enabled versioning to manage and track changes over time.
- **Lifecycle Management**: Set up lifecycle rules to archive and delete older content, optimizing storage costs.
- **Cross-Region Replication**: Configured cross-Region replication for improved redundancy and disaster recovery.

By implementing these configurations, this project showcases a robust and scalable approach to static website hosting on AWS.
